      Start Point: Man Tor National Trust Car Park<br /><br />Mam Tor is a Peak
      District classic. Owned by the National Trust, the paths are well made and
      there are plenty of short circular walks in the area. The view over the
      Great Ridge is particularly good at sunrise and sunset, plus you'll avoid
      the late risers. Like they say, the early hiker catches the photo...
      Around Mam Tor area, there are lots of interesting cave and castles to
      explore.

    <p class="Hike-description">
      Level:Intermediate <br /><br />
      Length:31km<br /><br />Ascent:650m<br /><br />Start Point:Edale Train
      Station<br /><br />From the train station, walk up the hill and turn left
      onto the Pennine Way. Follow the waymarkers across fields and through
      Upper Booth village until you reach open moorland. This is Jacob's Ladder
      path, which winds steeply up onto Kinder Plateau. It is a paved and
      well-used path, named after Jacob Marshall, a local farmer who first cut
      steps into the hillside in the 1700s.

      Level:Hard<br /><br />Length:16km<br /><br />Ascent:80km<br /><br />Start
      Point:Glenridding Tourist Information Centre<br /><br />The most iconic
      mountain in the Lake District. It has many claims to fame: third highest
      mountain in England, two popular scramble ridges and some favourable words
      from Alfred Wainwright. Supposedly, if the weather is good, you can see
      Scotland and Wales from the top, never mind most of the bodies of water in
      the Lake District.

    <p class="Hike-description">
      Level: Veteran <br /><br />
      Length: 160km <br /><br />
      Ascent: 736m <br /><br />
      Starting point: Horton-in-Ribblesdale<br /><br />
      1. Pen-y-Ghent: Peaks at 694m, a steep ascent with views across the Dales,
      because it is a little exposed, the rocky terrain makes an interesting
      challenge.<br />
      Whernside: This is the highest of the 3 Peaks, a less dramatic ascent than
      the other two. And so, a slow gradual climb, with stunning views and
      scenery along the way. <br />
      Ingleborough: Another steep ascent is over quickly with breath-taking
      views, to a gentle descent into Horton-in-Ribblesdale.
